ScalaMeter 0.4 for Scala 2.10 is now available on maven central!

The centerpiece of this release is HTML reporter based on the D3 visualization library. You can see a live example of the [report page here](http://chara.epfl.ch/~prokopec/example/tmp/report/). This new HTML reporter is the default reporter used in `PerformanceTest.Regression` tests.

Some of its features are:

* x-axis choice for composed generators â€“ allows choosing whether problem size, parallelism level or the measurement date are on the x-axis
* chart and histogram view of the measurements
* confidence interval display
* filtering input parameters interactively
* choosing tests from different test groups interactively
* permalinks that allow sharing the chosen configuration of displayed test groups and input parameters
